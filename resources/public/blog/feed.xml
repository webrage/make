Hello world
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;I have been wanting to play with &lt;a href='http://cryogenweb.org'&gt;Cryogen&lt;/a&gt; for a while now. It is a clojure based helper for creating static web sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having had a quick look at it I have decided to go with the lotus theme that you can see now. This will be the place where I post about the interesting things I create at my local makerspace (&lt;a href='http://hackland.nz'&gt;HackLand&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;setup&amp;#95;issues&quot;&gt;setup issues&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;cryogen&quot;&gt;cryogen&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;With any new process there is stuff to learn and figure out. Being familiar with clojure I was quickly able to bring the getting started website to life at localhost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;lotus&amp;#95;theme&quot;&gt;lotus theme&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fun began when I decided to go with the lotus theme and the website wouldn't render in the browser. This theme uses &lt;a href='https://sass-lang.com/'&gt;SASS&lt;/a&gt; for its style sheets so I had to install the SASS command-line app and update the config file.  I was happy to install this as it looks interesting. Still no luck. Turns out the latest version of the SASS command-line app doesn't work the same as previously, leaving cryogen throwing an error when called.  My current work-around is for me to call it manually, more a cludge than a fix...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;github&quot;&gt;github&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;netlify&quot;&gt;netlify&lt;/h4&gt;
